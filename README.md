AI applications need alterations from centralized learning systems to large-scale distributed AI systems to perform complex and challenging tasks. Also, there is a concern about privacy and requirements for train data locally. Federated Learning is an example of a distributed AI process. In the Federated learning system, all the end devices train a model under the supervision of a central server and maintain the decentralization of the training data. At the initial level, the devices download the primary server’s base model at their preferable time stamp. The model is trained based on the local data and sends the trained model to the server. After that, the server overhauls the base show with the total parameter values of user-trained models. This training cycle keeps going until we get the desired model. Here the end devices keep their local data and use their locally computed data to train the shared model, ensuring data privacy. The data in the device is related to the model’s application..
